Multiple unlinked variants, associated to the same complex trait, often converged on trans-genes that are known to play central roles in disease etiology.

By applying ARCHIE to available trans-eQTL summary statistics reported by the eQTLGen consortium, we identify 71 gene networks which have significant evidence of trans-association with groups of known genetic variants across 29 complex traits. A majority (50.7%) of the genes do not have any strong trans-associations and could not have been detected by standard trans-eQTL mapping. We provide further evidence for causal basis of the target genes through a series of follow-up analyses.

These data can be used to explain disease related genetic variants by linking them to intermediate molecular traits (quantitative trait loci, QTL). Molecular networks regulating cellular processes leave footprints in QTL results as so-called trans -QTL hotspots. Reconstructing these networks is a complex endeavor and use of biological prior information has been proposed to alleviate network inference. However, previous efforts were limited in the types of priors used or have only been applied to model systems. In this study, we reconstruct the regulatory networks underlying trans -QTL hotspots using human cohort data and data-driven prior information.\n  \n  Results: We devised a strategy to integrate QTL with human population scale multi-omics data and comprehensively curated prior information from large-scale biological databases. State-of-the art network inference methods applied to these data and priors were used to recover the regulatory networks underlying trans -QTL hotspots. We benchmarked inference methods and showed, that Bayesian strategies using biologically-informed priors outperform methods without prior data in simulated data and show better replication across datasets. Application of our approach to human cohort data highlighted two novel regulatory networks related to schizophrenia and lean body mass for which we generated novel functional hypotheses.\n  \n  Conclusion: We demonstrate, that existing biological knowledge can be leveraged for the integrative analysis of networks underlying trans associations to deduce novel hypotheses on cell regulatory mechanisms.","tags":[],"title":"Network reconstruction for trans acting genetic loci using multi-omics data and prior information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dipender Gill","Marios Arvanitis","Paul Carter","Ana I Hernandez Cordero","Brian Jo","Ville Karhunen","Susanna C Larsson","Xuan Li","Sam M Lockhart","Amy M Mason","Evanthia Pashos","Ashis Saha","Vanessa Tan","Verena Zuber","Yohan Bosse","Sarah Fahle","Ke Hao","Tao Jiang","Philippe Joubert","Alan C Lunt","Willem hendrik Ouwehand","David J Roberts","Wim Timens","Maarten van den Berge","Nicholas A Watkins","Alexis Battle","Adam S Butterworth","John Danesh","Barbara E Engelhard","James E Peters","Don Sin","Stephen Burgess"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586822400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586822400,"objectID":"89add08c49ff8261c64cec62d3c8777a","permalink":"https://alorchhota.github.io/publication/covid_mr/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/covid_mr/","section":"publication","summary":"  Objectives To use human genetic variants that proxy angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug effects and cardiovascular risk factors to provide insight into how these exposures affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression and circulating ACE2 levels.\n  Design Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.\n  Setting Summary-level genetic association data.\n  Participants Participants were predominantly of European ancestry.

Nearly 40% of expressed genes fall into brain-wide modules corresponding to major cell classes and conserved biological processes. Region-specific modules comprise 25% of expressed genes and correspond to region-specific cell types and processes, such as oxytocin signaling in the hypothalamus, or addiction pathways in the nucleus accumbens. We further leverage these modules to capture cell-type-specific lncRNA and gene isoforms, both of which contribute substantially to regional synaptic diversity. We identify enrichment of neuropsychiatric disease risk variants in brain wide and multi-regional modules, consistent with their broad impact on cell classes, and highlight specific roles in neuronal proliferation and activity-dependent processes.

A substantial portion of gene expression variation can be explained by both local (cis) and distal (trans) genetic variation.

Here we take advantage of our ability to predict the cis component of gene expression coupled with gene mapping methods such as PrediXcan to identify high confidence candidate trans‐acting genes and their targets. That is, we correlate the cis component of gene expression with observed expression of genes in different chromosomes. Leveraging the shared cis‐acting regulation across tissues, we combine the evidence of association across all available Genotype‐Tissue Expression Project tissues and find 2,356 trans‐acting/target gene pairs with high mappability scores. Reassuringly, trans‐acting genes are enriched in transcription and nucleic acid binding pathways and target genes are enriched in known transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, trans‐acting genes are more significantly associated with selected complex traits and diseases than target or background genes, consistent with percolating trans effects.

While this is well known, the downstream consequences of misalignment have not been fully characterized. We assessed the potential for incorrect alignment of RNA-sequencing reads to cause false positives in both gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and co-expression analyses. Trans-eQTLs identified from human RNA-sequencing studies appeared to be particularly affected by this phenomenon, even when only uniquely aligned reads are considered. Over 75% of trans-eQTLs using a standard pipeline occurred between regions of sequence similarity and therefore could be due to alignment errors. Further, associations due to mapping errors are likely to misleadingly replicate between studies. To help address this problem, we quantified the potential for \"cross-mapping'' to occur between every pair of annotated genes in the human genome. Such cross-mapping data can be used to filter or flag potential false positives in both trans-eQTL and co-expression analyses. Such filtering substantially alters the detection of significant associations and can have an impact on the assessment of false discovery rate, functional enrichment, and replication for RNA-sequencing association studies.","tags":[],"title":"False positives in trans-eQTL and co-expression analyses arising from RNA-sequencing alignment errors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["The GTEx Consortium"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507766400,"objectID":"b1c2244ce3420631189488bc58bea87b","permalink":"https://alorchhota.github.io/publication/gtex_v6/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gtex_v6/","section":"publication","summary":"Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases.

Here, we built networks that additionally capture the regulation of relative isoform abundance and splicing, along with tissue-specific connections unique to each of a diverse set of tissues. We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6 RNA sequencing data across 50 tissues and 449 individuals. First, we developed a framework called Transcriptome-Wide Networks (TWNs) for combining total expression and relative isoform levels into a single sparse network, capturing the interplay between the regulation of splicing and transcription. We built TWNs for 16 tissues and found that hubs in these networks were strongly enriched for splicing and RNA binding genes, demonstrating their utility in unraveling regulation of splicing in the human transcriptome. Next, we used a Bayesian biclustering model that identifies network edges unique to a single tissue to reconstruct Tissue-Specific Networks (TSNs) for 26 distinct tissues and 10 groups of related tissues. Finally, we found genetic variants associated with pairs of adjacent nodes in our networks, supporting the estimated network structures and identifying 20 genetic variants with distant regulatory impact on transcription and splicing.

However, the regulation of alternative splicing is not fully understood, including the factors that lead to tissue-specific control of alternative splicing. Unraveling the regulation of alternative splicing in the form of a network has the potential to elucidate complex biological mechanisms. Until recently, well-studied regulatory network inference methods predominantly used total gene expression data. However, with the advent of RNA-sequencing, we are now able to simultaneously quantify a diverse range of transcription phenotypes, including alternative splicing, non-coding transcripts, and allele-specific expression. We can discover new regulatory relationships by using these phenotypes during network construction. Here we build transcriptome-wide networks (TWN) over both gene expression and alternative splicing from RNA-seq data using sparse Gaussian Markov random fields. We identify multiple types of candidate regulatory relationships where i) gene expression regulates alternative splicing, ii) alternative splicing regulates gene expression, iii) gene expression of a gene regulates that of other genes, and iv) alternative splicing of a gene regulates that of other genes. We learn TWNs for 23 different human tissues using RNA-seq data from the GTEx project. Our networks are enriched with edges between known transcription factors and their target genes, demonstrating our model's effectiveness to find true regulatory relationships. Further, candidate splicing regulator genes identified by learned TWNs include many known RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), reflecting the role of RBPs in splicing. We integrate expression quantitative trait loci and allele-specific expressions to validate potentially causal relationships in TWNs, and demonstrate improved power to detect trans expression quantitative trait loci. Numerous tissue-specific regulatory relationships are identified by the TWNs, and are informative in characterizing context-specific behavior of regulatory elements. Our transcriptome-wide networks provide an opportunity to understand tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms for both alternative splicing and gene expression.","tags":[],"title":"Tissue-specific transcriptome-wide networks reflect joint regulation of alternative splicing and gene expression","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ashis Saha","Minji Jeon","Aik Choon Tan","Jaewoo Kang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1436140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1436140800,"objectID":"934d30605ae768d769e3f8dff8d111ff","permalink":"https://alorchhota.github.io/publication/icossy/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icossy/","section":"publication","summary":"Pathway analyses help reveal underlying molecular mechanisms of complex biological phenotypes. Biologists tend to perform multiple pathway analyses on the same dataset, as there is no single answer. It is often inefficient for them to implement and/or install all the algorithms by themselves. Online tools can help the community in this regard. Here we present an online gene expression analytical tool called iCOSSY which implements a novel pathway-based COntext-specific Subnetwork discoverY (COSSY) algorithm. iCOSSY also includes a few modifications of COSSY to increase its reliability and interpretability. Users can upload their gene expression datasets, and discover important subnetworks of closely interacting molecules to differentiate between two phenotypes (context). They can also interactively visualize the resulting subnetworks. iCOSSY is a web server that finds subnetworks that are differentially expressed in two phenotypes. Users can visualize the subnetworks to understand the biology of the difference.","tags":[],"title":"iCOSSY: An online tool for context-specific subnetwork discovery from gene expression data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashis Saha","Aik Choon Tan","Jaewoo Kang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"5e98b152b66519c34c79a90cdbef09ca","permalink":"https://alorchhota.github.io/publication/cossy/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cossy/","section":"publication","summary":"Genes act in concert via specific networks to drive various biological processes, including progression of diseases such as cancer. Under different phenotypes, different subsets of the gene members of a network participate in a biological process. Single gene analyses are less effective in identifying such core gene members (subnetworks) within a gene set/network, as compared to gene set/network-based analyses. Hence, it is useful to identify a discriminative classifier by focusing on the subnetworks that correspond to different phenotypes. Here we present a novel algorithm to automatically discover the important subnetworks of closely interacting molecules to differentiate between two phenotypes (context) using gene expression profiles. We name it COSSY (COntext-Specific Subnetwork discoverY). It is a non-greedy algorithm and thus unlikely to have local optima problems. COSSY works for any interaction network regardless of the network topology. One added benefit of COSSY is that it can also be used as a highly accurate classification platform which can produce a set of interpretable features.","tags":[],"title":"Automatic context-specific subnetwork discovery from large interaction networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1350146700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1350146700,"objectID":"0c7be82f6d06dc1e372181d9a8c9587b","permalink":"https://alorchhota.github.io/talk/tbc_2012/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/tbc_2012/","section":"talk","summary":"Recent studies suggest that biological pathways have the power to be stronger biomarkers for cancer than individual genes. The knowledgebase of pathways contains the interactions among the genes. However, it is not necessary for all the genes in a pathway to interact with each other. Closely interacting genes are supposed to have a collective effect to cause cancer or other disease. Here we propose a novel cancer classification method utilizing the collective effect of the set of closely interacting genes which we call Gene Interaction Set (GIS). We first find out the possible strength levels of each gene interaction set using clustering method and then rank all the sets with our proposed entropy metric using the proportion of samples of different classes having same strength level and finally predict the class of a new sample by weighted voting of top k gene interaction sets. The important feature of our method is that the process of causing the disease can easily be figured out. We validate our method comparing with other classification methods known to produce very high accuracy on 7 cancer datasets.","tags":[],"title":"Gene Interaction-Level Cancer Classification using Gene Expression Profiles","type":"talk"}]
