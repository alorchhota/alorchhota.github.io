Of course, we need it. Instead, the question is: how attractive and elegant is the website? Being a Ph.D. student, it\u0026rsquo;s not a surprise that I find an academic-theme website very attractive. Developing such a website from the scratch needs huge time and effort. Luckily, there are open source templates such as Hugo templates. Recently I created my website using such a template. Below is a blurred screenshot of the site.\nWhat I like about the website are:\n It is simple in design, attractive in appearance, and elegant in presentation. Easy to customize if you know R. HTML, JavaScript, or CSS knowledge is NOT necessary. The code is maintained as a repository in Github. As a result, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to edit or update the site. The site has been deployed in Github, no need to buy a domain name. It is also easy to deploy the site in a custom domain name. It offers a simple and powerful personal blogging feature. Seamlessly rendered in computers, cell-phones, iPads, and other devices.  Though the Hugo academic template was fairly simple, first I had to figure out how to use it and then how to customize it. I started by looking into the blog posts by Alison Hill, Leslie Myint, and Ming Tang. While each of these blogs was helpful, the actual development was slightly different because things have changed since their publications. Here I share how I used and personalized the template.\nI divide the website development into four steps.\n Requirement gathering Just running a template site Personalizing the site Hosting and deployment  Step-1: Requirement gathering  I have R and RStudio installed on my computer. Working knowledge of R coding is necessary. Installed blogdown package in R. The book blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown is a good resource to know the basics related to this website development. Installed GO language on the computer. I have a Github account. Working knowledge of Github is necessary.  Step-2: Just running a template site   I forked the starter-academic repository on my Github account. Alternatively, one can create a repository using starter-academic as a template.\n  Renamed the repository to alorchhota.github.io from Settings. Please note the name format here: [myaccountid].github.io. This name format would be useful later to deploy the website. Here is my repository \u0026ndash; you may take a look if you like.\n  Cloned the repository on my local computer using Terminal.\ngit clone https://github.com/alorchhota/alorchhota.github.io # remember to use your repository    Opened the repository in RStudio as a new package (from an existing directory). There I loaded the blogdown package and installed Hugo.\nlibrary(blogdown) blogdown::install_hugo()    Restarted RStudio \u0026ndash; required for loading the updated $PATH variable.\n  In Rstudio, I built the template website, and start the server.\nlibrary(blogdown) build_site() # hugo: downloading modules â€¦ # hugo: collected modules in 15019 ms # Start building sites â€¦ # # | EN # -------------------+----- # Pages | 52 # Paginator pages | 0 # Non-page files | 7 # Static files | 3 # Processed images | 39 # Aliases | 12 # Sitemaps | 1 # Cleaned | 0 # # Total in 26388 ms serve_site() # Launching the server via the command: # C:/Users/Shatil/AppData/Roaming/Hugo/0.80.0/hugo.exe server --bind 127.0.0.1 -p 4321 --themesDir themes -D -F --navigateToChanged # Serving the directory . at http://localhost:4321 # Launched the hugo server in the background (process ID: 9296). To stop it, call blogdown::stop_server() or restart the R session.  At this point, the template website was visible in the RStudio Viewer panel (see the image below). When I clicked on the button as marked by a red circle, the website opened in a web browser. Generally, the website updated updated each time I saved any change. Occasionally, I needed to stop the site by calling stop_server(), and then restart by calling build_site() and serve_site() manually.\n  Step-3: Personalizing the site The variables in the template repository are pretty self-explanatory and need no explanation. So, instead of describing every variable change, here I mention only the notable changes. You are welcome to visit my repository to see all changes.\n  Updated the title and copyright in the file: config/_default/config.toml keeping everything else unchanged.\n# Title of your site title = \u0026quot;Ashis Saha\u0026quot; # The URL of your site. # End your URL with a `/` trailing slash, e.g. `https://example.com/`. baseurl = \u0026quot;\u0026quot; # Enter a copyright notice to display in the site footer. # To display a copyright symbol, type `\u0026amp;copy;`. For current year, type `{year}`. copyright = \u0026quot;© 2020 Ashis Saha\u0026quot;    Deleted the demo file: content/home/demo.md.\n  Updated content/authors/admin/_index.md with personal information. Notably, I updated my name, changed the google-scholar icon, and added about-me. I also set highlight_name: true to highlight my names in publication-author lists.\n--- # Display name title: Ashis Saha # ... social: - icon: google-scholar icon_pack: ai link: https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=e6Ku7IIAAAAJ # ... # Highlight the author in author lists?

Most network analyses to date have been limited to assessing correlation between total gene expression levels in a single tissue or small sets of tissues. Here, we built networks that additionally capture the regulation of relative isoform abundance and splicing, along with tissue-specific connections unique to each of a diverse set of tissues. We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6 RNA sequencing data across 50 tissues and 449 individuals. First, we developed a framework called Transcriptome-Wide Networks (TWNs) for combining total expression and relative isoform levels into a single sparse network, capturing the interplay between the regulation of splicing and transcription. We built TWNs for 16 tissues and found that hubs in these networks were strongly enriched for splicing and RNA binding genes, demonstrating their utility in unraveling regulation of splicing in the human transcriptome. Next, we used a Bayesian biclustering model that identifies network edges unique to a single tissue to reconstruct Tissue-Specific Networks (TSNs) for 26 distinct tissues and 10 groups of related tissues. Finally, we found genetic variants associated with pairs of adjacent nodes in our networks, supporting the estimated network structures and identifying 20 genetic variants with distant regulatory impact on transcription and splicing. Our networks provide an improved understanding of the complex relationships of the human transcriptome across tissues. # # Summary.

We observed that cis-eQTLs can be detected for 88% of the studied genes, but that they have a different genetic architecture compared to disease-associated variants, limiting our ability to use cis-eQTLs to pinpoint causal genes within susceptibility loci. In contrast, trans-eQTLs (detected for 37% of 10,317 studied trait-associated variants) were more informative. Multiple unlinked variants, associated to the same complex trait, often converged on trans-genes that are known to play central roles in disease etiology. We observed the same when ascertaining the effect of polygenic scores calculated for 1,263 genome-wide association study (GWAS) traits.

In this study, we propose Aggregative tRans assoCiation to detect pHenotype specIfic gEne-sets (ARCHIE), as a method to establish links between sets of known genetic variants associated with a trait and sets of co-regulated gene-expressions through trans associations. ARCHIE employs sparse canonical correlation analysis based on summary statistics from trans-eQTL mapping and genotype and expression correlation matrices constructed from external data sources. We propose a resampling based procedure to test for significant trait-specific trans-association patterns in the background of highly polygenic regulation of gene-expression. By applying ARCHIE to available trans-eQTL summary statistics reported by the eQTLGen consortium, we identify 71 gene networks which have significant evidence of trans-association with groups of known genetic variants across 29 complex traits. A majority (50.7%) of the genes do not have any strong trans-associations and could not have been detected by standard trans-eQTL mapping. We provide further evidence for causal basis of the target genes through a series of follow-up analyses. These results show ARCHIE is a powerful tool for identifying sets of genes whose trans regulation may be related to specific complex traits.","tags":[],"title":"Novel Aggregative trans-eQTL Association Analysis of Known Genetic Variants Detect Trait-specific Target Gene-sets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["The GTEx Consortium"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599782400,"objectID":"21cd7a6b1932b7d1a443eeed49f27708","permalink":"https://alorchhota.github.io/publication/gtex_v8/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gtex_v8/","section":"publication","summary":"The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was established to characterize genetic effects on the transcriptome across human tissues and to link these regulatory mechanisms to trait and disease associations.

Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.","tags":[],"title":"The GTEx Consortium atlas of genetic regulatory effects across human tissues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johann S Hawe","Ashis Saha","Melanie Waldenberger","Sonja Kunze","Simone Wahl","Martina Mueller-Nurasyid","Holger Prokisch","Harald Grallert","Christian Herder","Annette Peters","Konstatin Strauch","Fabian J Theis","Christian Gieger","John Chambers","Alexis Battle","Matthias Heinig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590019200,"objectID":"78c0994c60d37ae265e0f6849c6fdac3","permalink":"https://alorchhota.github.io/publication/trans_network/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/trans_network/","section":"publication","summary":"  Background: Molecular multi-omics data provide an in-depth view on biological systems, and their integration is crucial to gain insights in complex regulatory processes. These data can be used to explain disease related genetic variants by linking them to intermediate molecular traits (quantitative trait loci, QTL). Molecular networks regulating cellular processes leave footprints in QTL results as so-called trans -QTL hotspots. Reconstructing these networks is a complex endeavor and use of biological prior information has been proposed to alleviate network inference. However, previous efforts were limited in the types of priors used or have only been applied to model systems. In this study, we reconstruct the regulatory networks underlying trans -QTL hotspots using human cohort data and data-driven prior information.\n  \n  Results: We devised a strategy to integrate QTL with human population scale multi-omics data and comprehensively curated prior information from large-scale biological databases. State-of-the art network inference methods applied to these data and priors were used to recover the regulatory networks underlying trans -QTL hotspots. We benchmarked inference methods and showed, that Bayesian strategies using biologically-informed priors outperform methods without prior data in simulated data and show better replication across datasets. Application of our approach to human cohort data highlighted two novel regulatory networks related to schizophrenia and lean body mass for which we generated novel functional hypotheses.\n  \n  Conclusion: We demonstrate, that existing biological knowledge can be leveraged for the integrative analysis of networks underlying trans associations to deduce novel hypotheses on cell regulatory mechanisms.","tags":[],"title":"Network reconstruction for trans acting genetic loci using multi-omics data and prior information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dipender Gill","Marios Arvanitis","Paul Carter","Ana I Hernandez Cordero","Brian Jo","Ville Karhunen","Susanna C Larsson","Xuan Li","Sam M Lockhart","Amy M Mason","Evanthia Pashos","Ashis Saha","Vanessa Tan","Verena Zuber","Yohan Bosse","Sarah Fahle","Ke Hao","Tao Jiang","Philippe Joubert","Alan C Lunt","Willem hendrik Ouwehand","David J Roberts","Wim Timens","Maarten van den Berge","Nicholas A Watkins","Alexis Battle","Adam S Butterworth","John Danesh","Barbara E Engelhard","James E Peters","Don Sin","Stephen Burgess"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586822400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586822400,"objectID":"89add08c49ff8261c64cec62d3c8777a","permalink":"https://alorchhota.github.io/publication/covid_mr/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/covid_mr/","section":"publication","summary":"  Objectives To use human genetic variants that proxy angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug effects and cardiovascular risk factors to provide insight into how these exposures affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression and circulating ACE2 levels.\n  Design Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.\n  Setting Summary-level genetic association data.\n  Participants Participants were predominantly of European ancestry.

Region-specific modules comprise 25% of expressed genes and correspond to region-specific cell types and processes, such as oxytocin signaling in the hypothalamus, or addiction pathways in the nucleus accumbens. We further leverage these modules to capture cell-type-specific lncRNA and gene isoforms, both of which contribute substantially to regional synaptic diversity. We identify enrichment of neuropsychiatric disease risk variants in brain wide and multi-regional modules, consistent with their broad impact on cell classes, and highlight specific roles in neuronal proliferation and activity-dependent processes.

A substantial portion of gene expression variation can be explained by both local (cis) and distal (trans) genetic variation. Much progress has been made in uncovering cis‐acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis‐eQTL), but trans‐eQTL have been more difficult to identify and replicate. Here we take advantage of our ability to predict the cis component of gene expression coupled with gene mapping methods such as PrediXcan to identify high confidence candidate trans‐acting genes and their targets. That is, we correlate the cis component of gene expression with observed expression of genes in different chromosomes. Leveraging the shared cis‐acting regulation across tissues, we combine the evidence of association across all available Genotype‐Tissue Expression Project tissues and find 2,356 trans‐acting/target gene pairs with high mappability scores. Reassuringly, trans‐acting genes are enriched in transcription and nucleic acid binding pathways and target genes are enriched in known transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, trans‐acting genes are more significantly associated with selected complex traits and diseases than target or background genes, consistent with percolating trans effects.

While this is well known, the downstream consequences of misalignment have not been fully characterized. We assessed the potential for incorrect alignment of RNA-sequencing reads to cause false positives in both gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and co-expression analyses. Trans-eQTLs identified from human RNA-sequencing studies appeared to be particularly affected by this phenomenon, even when only uniquely aligned reads are considered. Over 75% of trans-eQTLs using a standard pipeline occurred between regions of sequence similarity and therefore could be due to alignment errors. Further, associations due to mapping errors are likely to misleadingly replicate between studies. To help address this problem, we quantified the potential for \"cross-mapping'' to occur between every pair of annotated genes in the human genome. Such cross-mapping data can be used to filter or flag potential false positives in both trans-eQTL and co-expression analyses. Such filtering substantially alters the detection of significant associations and can have an impact on the assessment of false discovery rate, functional enrichment, and replication for RNA-sequencing association studies.","tags":[],"title":"False positives in trans-eQTL and co-expression analyses arising from RNA-sequencing alignment errors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["The GTEx Consortium"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507766400,"objectID":"b1c2244ce3420631189488bc58bea87b","permalink":"https://alorchhota.github.io/publication/gtex_v6/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gtex_v6/","section":"publication","summary":"Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases.

We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6 RNA sequencing data across 50 tissues and 449 individuals. First, we developed a framework called Transcriptome-Wide Networks (TWNs) for combining total expression and relative isoform levels into a single sparse network, capturing the interplay between the regulation of splicing and transcription. We built TWNs for 16 tissues and found that hubs in these networks were strongly enriched for splicing and RNA binding genes, demonstrating their utility in unraveling regulation of splicing in the human transcriptome. Next, we used a Bayesian biclustering model that identifies network edges unique to a single tissue to reconstruct Tissue-Specific Networks (TSNs) for 26 distinct tissues and 10 groups of related tissues. Finally, we found genetic variants associated with pairs of adjacent nodes in our networks, supporting the estimated network structures and identifying 20 genetic variants with distant regulatory impact on transcription and splicing.

However, the regulation of alternative splicing is not fully understood, including the factors that lead to tissue-specific control of alternative splicing. Unraveling the regulation of alternative splicing in the form of a network has the potential to elucidate complex biological mechanisms. Until recently, well-studied regulatory network inference methods predominantly used total gene expression data. However, with the advent of RNA-sequencing, we are now able to simultaneously quantify a diverse range of transcription phenotypes, including alternative splicing, non-coding transcripts, and allele-specific expression. We can discover new regulatory relationships by using these phenotypes during network construction. Here we build transcriptome-wide networks (TWN) over both gene expression and alternative splicing from RNA-seq data using sparse Gaussian Markov random fields. We identify multiple types of candidate regulatory relationships where i) gene expression regulates alternative splicing, ii) alternative splicing regulates gene expression, iii) gene expression of a gene regulates that of other genes, and iv) alternative splicing of a gene regulates that of other genes. We learn TWNs for 23 different human tissues using RNA-seq data from the GTEx project. Our networks are enriched with edges between known transcription factors and their target genes, demonstrating our model's effectiveness to find true regulatory relationships. Further, candidate splicing regulator genes identified by learned TWNs include many known RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), reflecting the role of RBPs in splicing. We integrate expression quantitative trait loci and allele-specific expressions to validate potentially causal relationships in TWNs, and demonstrate improved power to detect trans expression quantitative trait loci. Numerous tissue-specific regulatory relationships are identified by the TWNs, and are informative in characterizing context-specific behavior of regulatory elements.

Hence, it is useful to identify a discriminative classifier by focusing on the subnetworks that correspond to different phenotypes.

We name it COSSY (COntext-Specific Subnetwork discoverY). It is a non-greedy algorithm and thus unlikely to have local optima problems.

Here we propose a novel cancer classification method utilizing the collective effect of the set of closely interacting genes which we call Gene Interaction Set (GIS). We first find out the possible strength levels of each gene interaction set using clustering method and then rank all the sets with our proposed entropy metric using the proportion of samples of different classes having same strength level and finally predict the class of a new sample by weighted voting of top k gene interaction sets.
