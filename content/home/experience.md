  - title: Scientific Researcher
    company: Genentech, Inc.
    company_url: 'www.gene.com'
    location: South San Fransisco, USA
    date_start: '2021-05-10'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
      I analyze biological data and apply statistical and machine learning methods in order to identify and enhance
understanding of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Here, my responsibilities include:
        - Analyzing large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in cancer immunology clinical trial cohorts and real world data.
        - Analyzing the roles of immunogenetic variations in determining survival and adverse events in cancer patients.
        - Investigating the impact of inherited genetic variation on tumor evolution and mutational patterns.
        - Performing integrated analyses of multidimensional molecular data sets to better understand anti-tumor immune responses.

  - title: Research Assistant
    company: Battle Lab, Johns Hopkins University
    company_url: 'battlelab.jhu.edu/'
    location: Baltimore, USA
    date_start: '2014-09-01'
    date_end: '2021-04-15'
    description: |2-
      At the Battle Lab, I worked to develop and use computational methods to understand, analyze and interpret gene regulation in humans. Here, my responsibilities included:
        - Improving accuracy and interpretability of co-expression networks,
        - Studying regulation of transcription and splicing using bulk and
        single-cell RNA-seq,
        - Establishing best practices for co-expression and trans-eQTL analysis,
        - Uncovering genetic effects on gene expression across diverse human tissues as part of two big consortia (GTEx and eQTLGen) and other collaborations, and
        - Mentoring junior lab members.
        
  - title: Qualifying Project Developer
    company: Langmead Lab, Johns Hopkins University
    company_url: 'http://www.langmead-lab.org/'
    location: Baltimore, USA
    date_start: '2019-06-18'
    date_end: '2020-06-19'
    description: With Dr. Ben Langmead, I studied the application of sketch data structures in computational genomics. We showed that the conservative count-min sketch consistently provides more accurate estimates than the regular count-min sketch. We also developed two sketch algorithms – offline count-min sketch and offline conservative count-min sketch – that visit the k-mers multiple times to improve estimates.

    date_end: '2014-07-30'
    description: |2-
      At DMIS lab, my responsibility was to
        - Develop methods to find disease-causing pathways or co-expressed genes using microarray gene expression profiles, and
        - Create tools to visualize and interpret gene interactions.
