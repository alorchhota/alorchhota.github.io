### Badhan (a voluntary blood donors' organization)
<center><img src="media/blood_donation.jpg"></center>

[Badhan](https://www.badhan.org) has been a defining chapter for me. I have been an active volunteer for the organization since 2002. I served Badhan in different capacities including as the President of Badhan, Buet Zone in 2005. I am now a central adviser of the organization. So far I donated blood ~30 times (lost counting). The above photo was taken while donating platelets in 2010.

### Photography

I'm a hobbyist photographer. Birds and wild animals especially attract me. You are welcome to visit [my 500px profile](https://500px.com/p/alorchhota) to see a few of my photographs.

### Travel
