Whether one needs a personal website for professional growth is out of question. Of course, we need it. Rather the main question is - how attractive and elegant is the website? Being a Ph.D. student, it's not a surprise that I like an academic-theme website. Developing a nice website from the scratch needs huge time and efforts. Luckily, there are open source templates. While these templates are fairly simple, we need to know how to customize them.

I recently developed <a href="https://alorchhota.github.io/" target="_blank">my website</a> using R, hugo and github. A blurred screenshot is shown in the above picture. What I like about the website are:
- It is simple in design, attractive in appearance, and elegant in presentation.
- Easy to customize.
- The code is maintained as a repository in Github. As a result, it's easy to edit or update the site.
- The site has been deployed in Github, no need to buy a domain name. It is also easy to deploy the site in a custom domain name.
- It offers a simple and powerful personal blogging feature.
- Seamlessly rendered in computer, cell-phone, iPad, and other devices.

Before I started developing the website, I looked into the blog posts by [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/), [Leslie Myint](https://lmyint.github.io/post/hugo-academic-tips/), and  [Ming Tang](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/post/hugo-academic-theme-blog-down-deployment-some-details/). While each of these blogs was helpful, the actual development was a bit different, because the hugo theme and the templates have changed (improved). Here I share how I customized the website.

## Overview

1. The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more
