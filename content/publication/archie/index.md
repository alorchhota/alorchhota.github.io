abstract: Large scale genetic association studies have identified many trait-associated variants and understanding the role of these variants in downstream regulation of gene-expressions can uncover important mediating biological mechanisms. In this study, we propose Aggregative tRans assoCiation to detect pHenotype specIfic gEne-sets (ARCHIE), as a method to establish links between sets of known genetic variants associated with a trait and sets of co-regulated gene-expressions through trans associations. ARCHIE employs sparse canonical correlation analysis based on summary statistics from trans-eQTL mapping and genotype and expression correlation matrices constructed from external data sources. We propose a resampling based procedure to test for significant trait-specific trans-association patterns in the background of highly polygenic regulation of gene-expression. By applying ARCHIE to available trans-eQTL summary statistics reported by the eQTLGen consortium, we identify 71 gene networks which have significant evidence of trans-association with groups of known genetic variants across 29 complex traits. A majority (50.7%) of the genes do not have any strong trans-associations and could not have been detected by standard trans-eQTL mapping. We provide further evidence for causal basis of the target genes through a series of follow-up analyses. These results show ARCHIE is a powerful tool for identifying sets of genes whose trans regulation may be related to specific complex traits.
