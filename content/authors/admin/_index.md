I am a computatonal researcher at <a href="https://www.gene.com">Genentech, Inc.</a> working with Christian Hammer. I closely work with fellows in the department of Human Genetics and the department of Cancer Immunology. Earlier, I completed my Ph.D. under supervision of <a href="https://battlelab.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> Dr. Alexis Battle </a> in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, USA.

As a computational biologist, I try to connect Computer Science with Biology by developing biologically-informed computational methods. I incorporate biological insights into the computational models so that the outcomes are interpretable. In my current research, I investigate the roles of genetic variants in the development and evolution of tumors in order to identify and enhance understanding of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. I leverage various kinds of biological data from both public consortia and clinical trials in cancer immunology.

I primarily use R for my research. I also use Python, Matlab and C/C++ whenever required. I care about efficient coding and reproducible research.
