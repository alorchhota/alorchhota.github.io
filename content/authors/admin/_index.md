I am a Ph.D. student advised by <a href="https://battlelab.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> Dr. Alexis Battle </a> in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, USA.

As a computational biologist, I try to connect Computer Science with Biology by developing biologically-informed computational methods. I incorporate biological insights into the computational models so that the outcomes are interpretable. In my current research, I leverage large scale DNA- and RNA-sequencing data to decipher gene regulatory relationships in humans. I deploy various computational techniques including co-expression networks and quantitative trait loci (QTL) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of genes and genetic variants.

I primarily use R for my research. I also use Python, Matlab and C/C++ whenever required. I care about efficient coding and reproducible research.
